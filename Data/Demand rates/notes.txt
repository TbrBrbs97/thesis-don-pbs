The files include mean demand rates for three demand scenarios from a stop to another for each line. 

1,  1,  2 means scenario 1, mean demand from stop 1 to 2. 
2,  2,  3 means scenario 2, mean demand from stop 2 to 3. 
... 

k, i, j is defined only for j > i. The stops are duplicated for the other direction. 
So, if there are 3 stops on the line where the 3rd is the city center, the stops until the city center are duplicated just after the city center for the other direction. 
Instead of traveling from 3 to 2, it is considered as 3 to 4, (stop 4 (actually stop 2), and stop 5 (actually stop 1) comes after city center).
You do not have to keep it like this, but you need to make sure that when you take this input that's what you should consider.  

lambdapeak: Mean demand to travel towards the city center during peak hours
mupeak: Mean demand to travel towards the terminal during peak hours
lambdarec: Mean demand to travel towards the city center outside peak hours
murec: Mean demand to travel towards the terminal outside peak hours
